# NonlinearSchrodingerNetwork

## TODO

- Find/Train best autoencoder architecture from grid search

- Get nonlinear evolution function to work using autoencoder compression
    - Test using training data from many different initial conditions (on the same Hamiltonian)
        - Keep some initial condition evolutions aside for validation

- Figure out what the next quantum system to work out should be
